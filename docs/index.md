There are several parts of the website you can alter...along with a few parts you cannot alter without manually changing code. The following cannot be changed without manually editing template files: 

- The copy & photos on the homepage
- The copy & content on the contact us page
- You can't edit the videos page directly (there is a script that configures the content on the page)
- The actual layout of any of the pages
